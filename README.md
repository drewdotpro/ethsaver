# EthSaver

An Ethereum Smart Contract that allows you to save ETH in it until a timestamp is reached on the blockchain.

Engage the `deposit` function as payable with a timestamp to deposit ETH. You may make further deposits and either increase or keep the existing timestamp.

Engage `withdraw` after the timestamp with the same address you deposited with to initiate withdrawal.
